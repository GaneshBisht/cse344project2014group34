### MEETING DATE ###
13.03.2013

### LOCATION ###
Marmara University Engineering Faculty B-Block Computer Lab(MB 454)

### ACTIVITIES ###
1. User requirements, system requirements and domain requirements were considered.<br>
2. We determined requirements of our project.<br>
3. The scenario of project was discussed.<br>
4. The tools and the platform are discussed. <br>
<blockquote>We are thinking of using Android platfrom <br>
which is based on Java programing language. <br>
We also use Xml as secondary language to implement<br>
interfaces and design. We will use Android Development Tool,<br>
which is called ADT. However, Eclipse is sufficient for development.<br>
We also use virtual devices or actual devices to test our project.<br>
We are thinking to use Adt Emulator, Geny Motion and smart phones.<br>
5. We were discussed about which process model will be hold.<br>
We made our decision about Waterfall model.<br>
Since, our requirements  are not changable. <br>
Our most requirements and events are certain;<br>
unlike some unstructured projects. <br>
So that is why we chose waterfall.<br>
We can go through the project step by step<br>
and after a phase is finished, then we can go to next phase.</blockquote>
